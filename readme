Reducing JWST raw data:

20240124_JWST_DRP_step1_HD19467B.py
    Process *_uncal.fits NIRSpec IFU files into *_rate.fits using stage 1 JWST calibration pipeline.

20240124_JWST_DRP_step2_HD19467B.py
    Process *_rate.fits NIRSpec IFU files into flux calibration *_cal.fits using stage 2 JWST calibration pipeline.

20240124_clean_rate_files_HD19467.py
    Clean the vertical stripping (1/f noise) as well as the charge diffusion from a saturated star.
    It does this with column-wise spline fitting of the background pixels.
    Even though this script processes *_rate.fits files, it still requires the *_cal.fits to retrieve the detector mask
    to identify where the IFU slices are.
    As a result, please run both 20240124_JWST_DRP_step1_HD19467B.py and 20240124_JWST_DRP_step2_HD19467B.py first.

20240124_figXX_clean_rate_files_HD19467_plot.py
    Plot illustration of 20240124_clean_rate_files_HD19467.py

Simple spectral extraction and flux calibration

20240129_fig8_fig9_spectral_extraction_A0_calibrator.py
    Fit a model PSF from WebbPSF to the A0 standard star NIRSpec IFU data used for flux calibration of the instrument.
    It extracts its spectrum and measure its centroid.
    An output of this script is a couple polynomial parameters used in other scripts to calibrate the flux extraction.

20240209_webbPSF_spectral_extraction_HD19467A.py
    Extract the spectrum of a saturated star (HD19467) by fitting a PSF model (WebbPSF) to the point cloud.

############
RDI and companion spectral extraction

20240201_RDI_reference_star.py
    PSF subtraction using a reference star.
    The script combines the point cloud of a science sequence (multiple dithers) and a the sequence of a reference star.
    Then, it fits the reference star point cloud (centroid & scaling factor) to the science data and subtracts it.

20240202_spectral_cubeish_extraction.py
    Create a kind of spectral cube from a NIRSpec IFU dataset.
    The flux is extracted from the combined point cloud by fitting a model PSF (WebbPSF) at each wavelength on a grid of
    spatial positions. The output can be used to not only extract the spectrum of the companion, but also get the
    spectra of the speckles around it to estimate errors.

20240205_extract_spec_HD19467B.py
    Extract and save the spectrum of HD19467B.

20240202_spectral_cube_matched_filter.py
    Perform a matched filter on the spectral cube (after RDI) made by 20240202_spectral_cubeish_extraction.py.
    This is how the S/N map and contrast curve of RDI is derived in Ruffio+2024.

20240205_fig3_summary_RDIspec.py
    Plot the spectrum of HD19467B.

############
Forward modeling (FM), detection maps, and contrast curves

20240123_breads_FM_snr_maps_HD19467.py
    Make S/N, flux, and flux error maps using the detector forward model and the breads framework for linear models.
    This is what is used to derive the FM contrast curve.

20240123_breads_FM_snr_maps_HD19467_combine.py
    Combine the outputs of 20240123_breads_FM_snr_maps_HD19467.py from multiple dithers for example.

20240127_fig2_fig13_detections_plot.py
    Plot the detection maps, contrast curves, and S/N histograms for FM and RDI.
    This relies on the outputs of:
        20240123_breads_FM_snr_maps_HD19467_combine.py (for FM)
        20240202_spectral_cube_matched_filter.py (for RDI)

20240123_breads_FM_contrast_curves_vs_teff_HD19467.py
    Process the HD19467B dataset varying the effective temperature of a BT-settl model
    Mostly identical to 20240123_breads_FM_snr_maps_HD19467.py otherwise.

20240123_fig25_breads_FM_injection_and_recovery_HD19467.py.py
    Injection and recovery test for the companion flux estimation of the forward model.

20240405_NIRSpec_IFU_ETC.py
    Simple ETC example to scale NIRSpec IFU contrast curves as a function of planet Teff, stellar apparent magnitude,
    integration time, and reference filter.

    FM+RDI Characterization: Fit a BTsettl grid using the forward model framework while including a RDI-based prior on the speckle intensity.
    Very similar to 20240123_breads_FM_snr_maps_HD19467.py, but instead of varying the position of the companion, we
    vary Teff and loggs. Most of the functions or identical otherwise.

20240123_fig19_fig20_breads_FM_tefflogggrid_HD19467_plot.py
    Plot the results of the BTsettl grid fit from 20240123_breads_FM_tefflogggrid_HD19467.py.
